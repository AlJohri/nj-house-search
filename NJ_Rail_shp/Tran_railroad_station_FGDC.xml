      <abstract>Point data delineating station point locations for rail, light rail, and subway service lines operated by NJ TRANSIT and connecting commuter lines operated by Port Authority Trans Hudson (PATH) and Port Authority Transit Corporation (PATCO). Points for most stations are located as delivered by NJT GIS, with a few exceptions. Some of the attributes have been updated. See process steps for details.</abstract>
      <purpose>Provides station location and attribute information for currently operated regional rail service. Data set is intended only for general planning and mapping use. Station points do not necessarily fall on rail line segments.</purpose>
      <supplinf>Most of the station points were heads-up digitized from New Jersey 2007 High Resolution Orthophotography or from New Jersey 2012 High Resolution Orthophotography, both of which have a 1 foot pixel size and tested accuracy of +/- 4 feet. Some of the station locations were derived from other sources. Data set is published in shapefile format (Esri). This shapefile does not include linear referencing m values, and the stations are not topologically connected to the rail lines. These data are re-published by NJ Office of Information Technology (NJOIT), Office of Geographic Information Systems (OGIS) under agreement with NJ TRANSIT - GIS-Transportation.</supplinf>

        <horizpar>Rail station location data for most of the lines were digitized from New Jersey 2007 HIgh Resolution Orthophotography, which has a tested accuracy of +/- 4 feet, NSSDA, and a one foot pixel size. Source of station data for subsurface lines (e.g. PATH, PATCO, Newark Light Rail) was not provided to metadata author. Some station locations for PATCO were edited using New Jersey 2012 High Resolution Orthoimagery and New Jersey 2015 High Resolution Orthoimagery, which met at least same accuracy standards as 2007 data.</horizpar>

        <procdesc>Shapefiles sent by NJ TRANSIT were compiled into a single file geodatabase feature class. Locations of some PATCO stations were edited, based on 2012 orthophotography, personal knowledge, and other publicly-accessible information. Attribute ATIS_ID was filled in from previous station layer, partly by joining on station name and partly by manual examination of station name and rail line. Entries were cross checked afterward using those fields. Station names were converted to title case and manually edited to make punctutation and abbreviation consistent. Most now match the previous version of the data, with station names edited by Steven Karp.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>January release of NJ TRANSIT data was compared to previously-published OGIS data by doing a select by location using a 500 ft intersect buffer. Records from the previous OGIS data were used for most stations. Wesmont station was added to OGIS data. The point for Bay Head station was moved to match NJ TRANSIT mapped location in their release of 2016-01-09. The point for the Princeton (University) station was moved to the new track centerline, in front of the newly-constructed station location, as shown on 2015 orthophotography.</procdesc>
