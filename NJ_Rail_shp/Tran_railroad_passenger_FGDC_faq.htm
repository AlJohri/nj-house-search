NJ TRANSIT Rail, Light Rail, and Subway Currently Operated Right-of-Way lines, with connecting PATH and PATCO Rail, 2016 (NAD83, NJSP feet)

</dd>
<dt><em>Abstract:</em>  
<dd>

Line data delineating right-of-way centerlines for rail, light rail, and subway service lines operated by NJ TRANSIT, and connecting commuter lines operated by Port Authority Trans Hudson (PATH) and Port Authority Transit Corporation (PATCO). Data set is in shapefile format (Esri).

</dd>
<dt><em>Supplemental_Information:</em>  
<dd>

This shapefile does not include linear referencing m values. Most of the lines were heads-up digitized from New Jersey 2007 High Resolution Orthophotography, which has a 1 foot pixel size and tested accuracy of +/- 4 feet. Some of the lines were derived from other sources. These data are re-published by NJ Office of Information Technology (NJOIT), Office of Geographic Information Systems (OGIS) under agreement with NJ TRANSIT - GIS-Transportation.
<br/>
The SEPTA Trenton Line is included (it connects with NJ TRANSIT Northeast Corridor line), but SEPTA West Trenton Line is not.

Data sources were gathered for a new release of rail line data by OGIS.
NJ TRANSIT GIS supplied shapefile of rail lines (included SEPTA Trenton Line, but not RiverLINE nor PATCO, and did not follow service pattern format).
Several previous releases of rail data by OGIS (most recent release was missing some lines).

Line work for a new publication of the NJ TRANSIT rail lines and connecting rail services was appended to a new shapefile from several sources:
-NJ TRANSIT regional rail service lines were used from the release published by OGIS in 2015, after spot-checking locations against NJ TRANSIT February 2016 delivery. Glenn Newman had stated there were no changes to rail lines. 
-NJ TRANSIT RiverLINE and Hudson-Bergen Light Rail lines were used from the release published by OGIS in 2015.
-NJ TRANSIT Newark Light Rail lines from the February delivery by NJT were edited to reflect two main service routes.
-PATH lines from the June 2014 publication by OGIS were edited to create a record for each main service pattern.
-PATCO line was copied from the OGIS 2015 release.
-SEPTA line was copied from NJT February 2016 delivery.
<br/>
The Princeton &quot;Dinky&quot; line was edited by OGIS to reflect changes apparent in 2015 orthoimagery.
