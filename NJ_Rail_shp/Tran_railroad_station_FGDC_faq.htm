NJ TRANSIT, PATH and PATCO Passenger Rail Station points, 2016 (NAD83, NJSP feet)

</dd>
<dt><em>Abstract:</em>  
<dd>

Point data delineating station point locations for rail, light rail, and subway service lines operated by NJ TRANSIT and connecting commuter lines operated by Port Authority Trans Hudson (PATH) and Port Authority Transit Corporation (PATCO). Points for most stations are located as delivered by NJT GIS, with a few exceptions. Some of the attributes have been updated. See process steps for details.

</dd>
<dt><em>Supplemental_Information:</em>  
<dd>

Most of the station points were heads-up digitized from New Jersey 2007 High Resolution Orthophotography or from New Jersey 2012 High Resolution Orthophotography, both of which have a 1 foot pixel size and tested accuracy of +/- 4 feet. Some of the station locations were derived from other sources. Data set is published in shapefile format (Esri). This shapefile does not include linear referencing m values, and the stations are not topologically connected to the rail lines. These data are re-published by NJ Office of Information Technology (NJOIT), Office of Geographic Information Systems (OGIS) under agreement with NJ TRANSIT - GIS-Transportation.

Shapefiles sent by NJ TRANSIT were compiled into a single file geodatabase feature class. Locations of some PATCO stations were edited, based on 2012 orthophotography, personal knowledge, and other publicly-accessible information. Attribute ATIS_ID was filled in from previous station layer, partly by joining on station name and partly by manual examination of station name and rail line. Entries were cross checked afterward using those fields. Station names were converted to title case and manually edited to make punctutation and abbreviation consistent. Most now match the previous version of the data, with station names edited by Steven Karp.

RAIL_LINE entry was edited to match case and punctuation as on NJ TRANSIT Web Site, PATH and PATCO Web Sites. MUN_LABEL field was also filled in from previous entries by Karp. Latitude and Longitude were calculated for station locations per NAD83. AMTRAK attribute was added and filled in based on AMTRAK Web page list and map of Northeast AMTRAK stations, from previous station layer.

January release of NJ TRANSIT data was compared to previously-published OGIS data by doing a select by location using a 500 ft intersect buffer. Records from the previous OGIS data were used for most stations. Wesmont station was added to OGIS data. The point for Bay Head station was moved to match NJ TRANSIT mapped location in their release of 2016-01-09. The point for the Princeton (University) station was moved to the new track centerline, in front of the newly-constructed station location, as shown on 2015 orthophotography.

Station names were edited by Steven Karp and checked by inspection.
<p>
</li>
<li><a name="quality.2"><b>How accurate are the geographic locations?</b></a><p>
Rail station location data for most of the lines were digitized from New Jersey 2007 HIgh Resolution Orthophotography, which has a tested accuracy of +/- 4 feet, NSSDA, and a one foot pixel size. Source of station data for subsurface lines (e.g. PATH, PATCO, Newark Light Rail) was not provided to metadata author. Some station locations for PATCO were edited using New Jersey 2012 High Resolution Orthoimagery and New Jersey 2015 High Resolution Orthoimagery, which met at least same accuracy standards as 2007 data.

<p>
</li>
<li><a name="quality.4"><b>Where are the gaps in the data?  What is missing?</b></a><p>
Includes only stations currently used by passenger rail service. Includes stations for non-NJ TRANSIT commuter rail service that connects with NJ TRANSIT service in terms of proximity, i.e. PATCO Speedline, and PANYNJ PATH service. Does include NJ TRANSIT Wesmont station, under construction.
<p>
</li>
<li><a name="quality.5"><b>How consistent are the relationships among the observations, including topology?</b></a><p>
The station points are not topologically connected to rail line data. They vary in accuracy and in location relative to tracks, platforms, and station buildings.
